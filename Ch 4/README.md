The exercise files and codespaces for Chapter 4 can be found on the other individual branches of this repo.

The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `04_02` corresponds to the fourth chapter and the second video in that chapter. 

Branches will also have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the exercise files for the other chapters of this course.
